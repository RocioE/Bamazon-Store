# Bamazon-Store
Welcome to Bamazon! This is an Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js.  This application implements a simple command line based storefront using the npm (Inquirer) and the MySQL database. In the customer portal customers may view: current inventory, item IDs, item descriptions, and item price.  If the customer selects quantity that is currently in stock, displaying "Great! Product is In Stock!" and updates the store database/inventory. When the selected quantity is not In Stock, the customer will get a prompted stating 'Insufficient quantity!'.
Happy Bamazon shopping!
